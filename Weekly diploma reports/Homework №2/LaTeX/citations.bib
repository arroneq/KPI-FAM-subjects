    abstract    = {This report explains the theory of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The emphasis is on the theory aspects in conjunction with the implementation issues that are encountered in a floating point processor. The main theory and implementation issues are based on the use of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the state density in the HMM, and a Continuous Density Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) is assumed. Suggestions and advice related to the implementation are given for a typical pattern recognition task.},

We (a) obtain a PTAS for the weighted Jaccard median problem and (b) show that the problem does not admit a FPTAS, even when restricted to binary vectors. The PTAS is built on a number of different algorithmic ideas and the hardness result makes use of an especially interesting gadget.},

@article{Rabiner1989,
    abstract  = {Although initially introduced and studied in the late 1960s and early 1970s, statistical methods of Markov source or hidden Markov modeling have become increasingly popular in the last several years. There are two strong reasons why this has occurred. First the models are very rich in mathematical structure and hence can form the theoretical basis for use in a wide range of applications. Second the models, when applied properly, work very well in practice for several important applications. In this paper we attempt to carefully and methodically review the theoretical aspects of this type of statistical modeling and show how they have been applied to selected problems in machine recognition of speech.},

The proposed method aims to recognize gestures from a single example, which is a challenging task due to the lack of sufficient training samples. The approach utilizes a set of visual features extracted from the hand region and employs HMMs to model the temporal dynamics of the gestures. Experimental results on benchmark gesture datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving high recognition accuracy even with limited training data. The one-shot learning approach shows promising results and has the potential to be applied in various gesture recognition applications.},

                Hierarchy Process (AHP). Put your decision making on a basis of
                logic \& consistency. The AHP technique helps you organize your
                thought processes in a logical fashion \& set priorities. This
                method is particularly applicable to decision making involving
                complex \& ill- or non-structured problems with both tangible \&
                intangible factors. You can predict likely outcomes, select the
                best alternatives, allocate resources according to priorities,
                conduct cost-benefit comparisons, plan projected or desired
                futures \& exercise control over changes in the decision making
                system. This is a book of case studies \& practical examples with
                an introduction to the theory. It can serve as a useful textbook
                in a decision making course in a graduate school of business.},
